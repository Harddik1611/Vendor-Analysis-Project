# ü•É Liquor Vendor Analysis: **Inventory & Sales Optimization**

# **üìå Problem Statement:**
Effective inventory and sales management are critical for optimizing profitability in the liquor retail and wholesale industry. Companies often face challenges such as:
* Inefficient pricing strategies
* Poor inventory turnover
* Vendor dependency and underperformance

This project aims to address these challenges through data analysis and visualization.


# **üéØ Objectives**
The core goals of this vendor analysis are to:
* ‚úÖ **Identify underperforming liquor brands** that may need promotional strategies or pricing adjustments.
* ‚úÖ **Highlight top liquor vendors** contributing to sales and gross profit.
* ‚úÖ **Analyze the impact of bulk purchasing** on unit cost reduction.
* ‚úÖ **Evaluate inventory turnover** to minimize holding costs and improve efficiency.
* ‚úÖ **Compare profitability variance** between high-performing and low-performing vendors.



# **üß∞ Tools & Technologies**
* **Python** (for data processing and analysis)
* **SQLite3** (for structured data storage and SQL queries)
* **SciPy/Statsmodels** (for statistical testing)
* **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for exploratory data visualization)
* **Power BI** (for interactive dashboard creation)


# **üóÇÔ∏è Project Workflow**

## **1. Data Integration:**
- Connected multiple .csv files using SQLite3 in Python.
- Performed SQL joins to merge and organize data efficiently.
- Exported the final dataset to a cleaned vendor_summary_sales dataset for further analysis.

## **2. Data Cleaning:**
- Removed duplicates and nulls.
- Standardized column names and formats.
- Converted relevant columns to appropriate data types for analysis.

## **3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
* Formulated some research questions such as:
    - Which vendors and brands demonstrate the highest sales performance ?
    - Which vendors contribute the most to total Purchase dollars ?
    - How much of total procurement is dependent on the top vendors ?
    - Does purchasing in bulk reduce the unit price, and what is the optimal purchase volume for cost savings ?
    - Which vendors have low inventory turnover, indicating excess stock and slow-moving products ?
    - How much Capital is locked in unsold inventory per vendor,and which vendors contribute the most to it ?
    - What is the 95% confidence interval for Profit Margins of Top-Performing and Low-Performing Vendors ? 
    - Is there a significant difference in profit margins between top-performing and low-performing vendors?
* Generated visualizations to identify patterns and outliers.

## **4. AB Testing & Statistical Analysis:**
- Performed a two-sample t-test on Profit Margin of low and high performing vendors.
- Calculated confidence intervals to assess the significance of observed changes.
- Performed descriptive statistics to understand groups behavior.


# **üìà AB Testing Results**
## **üìä Test: Difference in Profit Margins Between Vendor Tiers**
### **Research Question:**
- Is there a significant difference in profit margins between top-performing and low-performing vendors?
### **Hypotheses:**
- **H‚ÇÄ (Null Hypothesis)**: There is no significant difference in the mean profit margins of top-performing and low-performing vendors.
- **H‚ÇÅ (Alternative Hypothesis)**: The mean profit margins of top-performing and low-performing vendors are significantly different.

### **Test**: 
- Two-sample t-test
### **Significance Level (Œ±):**
- 0.05
### **p-value:**
- 0.0037
### **‚úÖ Result:** Since the p-value < 0.05, we **reject H‚ÇÄ**.
### **Conclusion:** There is a **statistically significant difference** in profit margins between top-performing and low-performing vendors.


# **üìä Power BI Dashboard**
- Built an interactive dashboard using the cleaned **vendor_summary_sales** dataset.

### Low-Performing Brands:
Brands with low average profit margins are prevalent across all sales ranges, suggesting a need for pricing review or cost control.

## Capital Efficiency:
- **Unsold Capital** of $2.71M indicates overstock or inefficiency in stock turnover.

# **‚úÖ Final Insights & Recommendations**
## **üìå Key Insights:**
- Top 10 vendors drive a disproportionate share of profitability‚Äî**65.7%** of sales.The remaining vendors contribute only **34.31%**, meaning they are not utilized effectively or may not be as competitive.
If vendor dependency is too high, consider identifying new suppliers to reduce risk.
- Vendors buying in bulk (Large Order Size) get the lowest unit price (**$10.78** per unit), meaning higher margins if they can manage inventory efficiently.
- The price difference between Small and Large orders is substantial (**~72%** reduction in unit cost)
- This suggests that bulk pricing strategies successfully encourage vendors to purchase in larger volumes, leading to higher overall sales despite lower per-unit revenue.
- Slow-moving inventory increases holding costs (warehouse rent, insurance, depreciation).
- Identifying vendors with low inventory turnover is critical for business efficiency, cost reduction, and profitability.

## **Insights Regarding AB-Testing:**
- The confidence interval for low-performing vendors (**40.48%** to **42.62%**) is significantly higher than that of top-performing vendors (**30.74%** to **31.61%**).
- This suggests that vendors with lower sales tend to maintain higher profit margins, potentially due to premium pricing or lower operational costs.
- For High-Performing Vendors: If they aim to improve profitability, they could explore selective price adjustments, cost optimization, or bundling strategies.
- For Low-Performing Vendors: Despite higher margins, their low sales volume might indicate a need for better marketing, competitive pricing, or improved distribution strategies.
- P-value=0.0000 of this small suggests that the difference is not just statistically significant but also practically meaningful.
- The two vendor groups operate very differently in terms of profitability.

## **‚úÖ Strategic Recommendations**
- **Re-evaluate pricing** for **low-sales**, **high-margin brands** to **boost sales volume** without sacrificing **profitability**. 
- Diversify **vendor partnerships** to reduce dependency on a few **suppliers** and mitigate **supply chain risks**. 
- Leverage **bulk purchasing** advantages to maintain **competitive pricing** while optimizing inventory management. 
- **Optimize slow-moving** inventory by adjusting **purchase quantities**, **launching clearance sales**, or **revising storage strategies**. 
- **Enhance marketing and distribution strategies** for low-performing vendors to drive higher **sales volumes** without compromising profit margins. 
- By implementing these recommendations, the company can achieve **sustainable profitability**,**mitigate risks**, and enhance overall **operational efficiency**.
